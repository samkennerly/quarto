ASAP:
  - finish pages (see preprint/outline.txt)
  - move site to neocities
  - quarto/export: sync target to neocities account?

CODE:
  - Google search bar?
  - markdown: use mistune.py ?
  - three.js example script
  - `gallerize` builds image galleries?
  - multithreading: one page per core?
  - tidylib C bindings (not subprocess)
  - Bottle or Flask demo app?

DOCS:
  - no install required
  - no __init__.py, __main__.py, setup.py, sys.path, PYTHONPATH, pip, venv
  - folders: { quarto: code, HTML: ready, CSS: style, media: target }
  - delete Dockerfile, kitchen if you don't want Docker
  - gotcha: spaces & weird chars in filenames
  - gotcha: can't delete empty folders because .DS_Store
  - gotcha: Tidy deletes head elements (including <style> tag(s)?)

STYLES:
  - style all <details> boxes, not just nav details
  - <div class="waffle"> for square galleries?
  - elemental: browser defaults
  - fatuous: ties the room together
  - graphic: graph gallery

TESTING:
  - test caps, spaces, underscores in page paths
  - what happens if old tidy is called?
  - nav: arrow keys, disability access OK?
  - speed tests: compare to Hugo, Jekyll, Middleman?
