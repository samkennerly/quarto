# `quire` scripts The `quire` folder contains four scripts. All four accept optional command-line arguments. Default arguments assume the scripts are called from a top-level quarto folder. ## `apply` ## `build` ## `clean` By default, this script <mark>overwrites</mark> HTML files in the `ready` folder. Anything in the &lt;head&gt; element of a page is <mark>deleted</mark>. ## `delete` Any leftover folders are *not* deleted. (Folder cleanup is complicated by the presence of hidden files like `.DS_Store`.)
