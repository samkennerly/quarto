## Neither a cloner nor a forker be.

- Create a new independent repo
[from this template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
- Each quarto project is a unique mixture of
[code](https://github.com/samkennerly/quarto/tree/master/quarto),
[pages](https://github.com/samkennerly/quarto/tree/master/ready),
and
[style](https://github.com/samkennerly/quarto/tree/master/style).
- If you
[clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository),
then `git pull` will pull this repo's pages and style into your repo.
- If you
[fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo),

## Is this a PR I see before me?

- Please do not submit a

- To share a custom quarto, create a public repo
[from this template](

- Beginners are welcome! Clever code which increases
[entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy)
is not.

## Files of few bytes are the best files.

- Large files in GitHub repos can cause
[problems](https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-large-files).
- Try to avoid uploading any file larger than a
[galaxy](proof/media/galaxy.jpg).
- Text files (HTML, CSS, MD, etc.) are rarely too big, but...
- Uploading 1,000+ lines of
[pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code)
is bad even if the files are small.

## No legacy is so rich as honesty.
