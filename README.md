This is the original <q>stock</q> quarto.

The site it builds is here:

## Is this a PR I see before me?

[pull request](https://github.com/samkennerly/quarto/pulls)

### True it is that we have seen better styles.

-  Most of the stock styles were made by a design
[rookie](https://samkennerly.github.io/).
Surely you can do better!
-  Create a new folder in the `style` folder and an
[example](examples/adrift.html)
to show off your style.
-  Styles can include non-CSS files, but `quire/apply` will ignore them.
-  CSS files need not be named `align.css`, `border.css`, etc.

### Neither a cloner nor a forker be.

- [merge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
- [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
- [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy)
- [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep)
- [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Files of few bytes are the best files.

- Large files in GitHub repos can cause
[problems](https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-large-files).
- Try to avoid uploading any file larger than a
[galaxy](media/galaxy.jpg).
- Text files (HTML, CSS, MD, etc.) are rarely too big, but...
- Code that resembles
[pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code)
should probably be
[refactored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring).

### No legacy is so rich as honesty.
